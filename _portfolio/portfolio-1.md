title: "Privacy Attacks Levaraging Model Explanations"
excerpt: "Machine learning systems are inherently vulnerable to privacy attacks, which can extract various aspects of the model, including its training data, model parameters, and sensitive attributes related to the training data. Moreover, model explanations can inadvertently disclose additional information that further aids such attacks. The goal is to assess the extent to which we can recover information from the model by leveraging this additional information"
